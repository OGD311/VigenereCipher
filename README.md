# Vigenere Cipher

## Explanation
Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. 
The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenere square or Vigenere table.

## My Version
My version uses a Vigenere square (at least on the backend) in order to encrypt the message.
The message will be converted from lower case to capital letters (and the output will be in capitals as well)
You cannot enter spaces in your message (as this reduces the security of the message and makes it easier to crack: e.g a 2 letter blank word is likely to be 'TO' or 'HI')
I recommend using a long key to ensure that the message is harder to crack.

CIBISYE! (Hint: use a *relevant* Key)
